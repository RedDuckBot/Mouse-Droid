# Mouse_Droid
A differential drive mouse droid, from the Star Wars universe, that was design for entertaining people at a house party. The droid is equiped with a revolving disco ball and can make actual mouse droid sounds heard from the movies. It is manually operated using an Xbox 360 wired controller. Overall, the operations of droid involves a raspberry pi 4B+, utilizing Ubuntu Server 22.04, and the running software application is built on the middleware ROS2 Humble. Majority of the parts are 3D printed and the droid consists of many other basic electronic components.

### 3D Printed Parts

The parts for the droids body were taken from a maker on Thingiverse, [Null_Hypothesis](https://www.thingiverse.com/null_hypothesis/designs). Here's the link to his project https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4229599.
From his project only the following parts are needed, given that the design needed to be hacked to work for a diff drive droid:
- 2 x Chassis_Rear_V4.stl
- Top_FrontV4.stl
- Top_RearV4.stl
- Top_rightV4.stl
- Top_RoofV4.stl
- TopLeftV4.stl
- 2 x Mouse_Droid_Side_Circuit_Board_Rescaled.stl   
- 2 x MSE_base 6to10.stl
- 2 x MSE_Lower_Portion6to10.stl
- 2 x MSE_Upper_Portion 6to10.stl
- 4 x Front_Tire.stl

The parts mentioned above and custom parts made for this project are in the 3D_print_files directory.
Portions of the chassis where the wheels go were cut out for placing the custom motor mounts, and a 64mm hole was cut out from the droid's roof for dico ball placement. Moreover, the custom disco platforms, made to hold electronic and mechanical components for operating the it, were suspended bellow the droid's roof using hex brass standoffs. [`Images`](./docs/images/) were taken to show assembeled components.  

## Circuit Diagrams 
### Disco Ball Circuit

</p>
Rotational control for the disco ball was done using a custom circuit, as shown above, involving a 555 timer, 4017 Decade counter, few resistors, capacitor, and an N-mosfet. This circuit generates steps for the stepper motor and was controlled off a pin from the Raspberry Pi that connected to the mosfet; operation can easily be achieved by directly connecting the Pi's pins to the ULN2003 Step board, instead of making and using the custom circuit.
Note: since the disco ball uses a USB connection a portion of the metal connector was cut out to expose the Vin and GND pins, which were soldered to the spin wires of the slip ring with the out wires connecting to the mosfet.


### Sound Board, Motor Controller, and IMU Circuit

In the above diagram, two power sources are utilized: 3s LIPO battery for powering the sound board and motors, and 5V battery bank for the Raspberry PI and disco circuit.
